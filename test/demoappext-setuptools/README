== Updating Extension ==

In order to update this extension for testing you'll need a clean venv with `Cython` and
then run the `cython` command to update the .c.

```
python -m venv /tmp/cython
. /tmp/cython/bin/activate
pip install "cython<3.0"

cd <repo_root>/test/demoappext-setuptools/demo
cython -3 -w . ext.pyx
```

After those commands are run you can inspect the difference if you like.
